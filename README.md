This project is a comprehensive IoT solution that monitors air quality using an MQ-135 gas sensor and a NodeMCU ESP32. The sensor data, including air quality, temperature, and humidity, is read by the ESP32 and sent to a Flask-based web server. The server stores the data and displays it in a web interface. This project demonstrates real-time environmental monitoring and data visualization, making it ideal for applications in smart home systems, environmental research, and IoT development. The code is designed to be modular and easily customizable for various use cases, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
